  <h6>What is this?</h6>

  <p>An easy method to test your own CSS on standard HTML elements. Test some styles for an existing site. Make some boilerplate to kick off a project!</p>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/opattison/Pattern-Primer-Jekyll">Fork or clone this repo for Jekyll on GitHub</a> if you want to try it out yourself with different styles or additional HTML elements or patterns.</p>

  <h6>Why a Jekyll fork?</h6>

  <p>Why not? I couldn't have built it in PHP myself, but I'm working on Jekyll projects and wanted to easily use Jeremy's tool without anything but Jekyll dependencies. It can be run locally or on a live server with great ease.</p>

  <h6>Credits</h6>
  <p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Get Jekyll</a>, a brilliant static site generator which this was built with. If anything, this site proves that you can build things other than hacker blogs with Jekyll.</p>
  <p>The <strong>original</strong> Pattern Primer is by adactio (<a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a>) and can be <a href="https://github.com/adactio/Pattern-Primer">forked on GitHub</a> if you prefer PHP or aren't already using Jekyll. Many thanks to Jeremy for this great tool!</p>

  <p>Pattern samples follow.</p>
